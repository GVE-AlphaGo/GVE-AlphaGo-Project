# GVE AlphaGo

## Introduction

This is the project created by GVE AlphaGo team.

Our project aims to provide customization of network visibility through a friendly interactive interface - Webex Teams bots who are able to connect to DNAC, push notification and retrieve information from DNAC. Instead of grabbing and filtering unrelated information from DNAC Dashboard manually, *Smart Assistance of Network Administrator* offers a more convenient and flexible approach to access data no matter where you are or which device you utilize.

This is the example code using Northbound APIs to accomplish the network visibility. Main functions are composed of two coding sections: Initiative notification from DNAC platform is delivered by Python after users select the needed event subscriptions. On the other hand, users are also capable of querying information from DNAC by communicating with our Webex Teams node.JS bot.
